## **Why This Exists**
This repository documents my professional transformation into a **Data Engineer with strong Machine Learning capability**.  
The strategy is simple:

1. Build **deep Python & Data fundamentals**
2. Master **Data Engineering + Cloud + Databricks**
3. Demonstrate **ML fluency** through real projects
4. Earn **3 high-signal certifications**
5. Present a **portfolio that proves production-minded execution**

This roadmap is **deliberate**, **disciplined**, and **designed to win**.
